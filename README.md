# Setup
Setup.sh

Is a script where it will try to make getting started, a matter of one, two, three. It will help install applications, secure servers, to even help you just clean up your computer. This script has been worked on by many people, and I personally have taken many other peoples work and implimented it here with their reference added to the top of the script. 

This is still very much an ongoing thing, and almost none of it works unless you know what your doing. If you want to help, feel free to email me at keyxmakerx@infinitexsolutions.net.

Thanks
